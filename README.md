# Comparative Analysis of ARIMA and LSTM Models for Forecasting Stock Closing Prices


## Overview
This project aims to interpret and compare the predictive performance of ARIMA, ARIMAX and ARFIM with the Exponential Smoothing model in forecasting stock closing prices. This involves assessing their accuracy across various time intervals, focusing on intervals prone to skewed data, outliers, and fluctuating market conditions. Additionally, the research aims to identify the strengths and limitations of each model in capturing the complexities of financial data, aiding investors in making informed decisions.
